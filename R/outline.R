# To do:
#   Identify all species with hormone data
#   Decide how to deal with stressor-exposed/not
#   Decide whether to use max cort or late stress cort
#   Measure distance from observation to range edge by species

# Hypotheses:
#   Stress increases near range edge (b/c of novel conditions)
#   Stress decreases near range edge (b/c lower density populations)

# Model:
#   Stress ~ log(distance range edge) + (log(distance range edge) | spp)
